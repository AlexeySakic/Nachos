    \section{Task 1}

    \subsection{Correctness Constraints}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[$\bullet$] Caller thread waits (sleep) until callee thread finishes.
      \item[$\bullet$] If callee thread has finishes, \texttt{join()} just returns
	directly.
      \item[$\bullet$] All the threads except caller thread should not be effected. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Declarations}
    Here, we can see that in order to implement \texttt{join()} method, we need callee
    thread sends a signal to caller thread once callee finished. Therefore, we use
    semaphore to reach this goal. 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[$\bullet$] \textit{data structures}: \texttt{Semaphore}.
      \item[$\bullet$] \textit{member variable}:
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item \textbf{private} \texttt{Semaphore KThread::finishSemaphore}, initially 0;
	\end{enumerate}
	indicate whether the thread is finished: \texttt{value} = 0 means unfinished, while
	\texttt{value} = 1 means finished.

    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Description}
    because \texttt{KThread::finishSemaphore} is a private
    member variable, we need to modify its value in methord \texttt{finish()}.  
    The pseudo code is as follows:
    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{\texttt{KThread::join()}}
      \begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\STATE /* the given code */
	\STATE finishSemaphore.P();
	\STATE finishSemaphore.V();
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{\texttt{KThread::finish()}}
      \begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\STATE /* the given code except sleep() */
	\STATE finishSemaphore.V();
	\STATE sleep(); // this code is the last line in the orginal KThread::finish()
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \subsection{Testing Plan}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[] case 1: Only 2 thread, \texttt{thread1} and \texttt{thread2}. 
	\texttt{thread1} calls \texttt{thread2.join()} before \texttt{thread2} finishes.
      \item[] case 2: Only 2 thread, \texttt{thread1} and \texttt{thread2}.
	\texttt{thread1} calls \texttt{thread2.join()} after \texttt{thread2} finishes.
      \item[] case 3: Only 3 thread, \texttt{thread1},\texttt{thread2} and
	\texttt{thread3}. \texttt{thread1} calls \texttt{thread2.join()} while
	\texttt{thread2} calls \texttt{thread3.join()}.
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Task 2}
    \subsection{Overview}
    In this task, we have to implement condition variables directly, by using enable and disable to provide atomicity instead semaphores. To be specific, we need to implement three functions \texttt{sleep()}, \texttt{wake()} and \texttt{wakeAll()} in \texttt{Condition2} as public functions.

    As for \texttt{sleep()}, we can first disable interrupts in order to make a small critical section, in which we only need to put it in a \texttt{ThreadQueue()} and announce it to sleep.

    And for \texttt{wake()}, it can be realized by taking the first element in the queue out, and call the \texttt{ready()} function.

    \texttt{wake()} can be done by running \texttt{wake()} iteratively.
    \subsection{Correctness Constraints}
    \begin{asparaitem}
    \item When \texttt{sleep()} is called, the thread is blocked in the critical section by disabling interrupts while no thread can wake it before the \texttt{KThread.sleep()} function.
    \item When \texttt{wake()} and \texttt{wakeAll()} are performed, we guarantee all of their instructions are done within a critical section surrounded by disabling and enabling interrupts.
    \end{asparaitem}
    \subsection{Declarations}
    \texttt{waitQueue} is a \texttt{ThreadQueue} for threads blocked by \texttt{sleep()}.
    \subsection{Description}
    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{ \texttt{void Condition2::sleep()}}
      \begin{algorithmic}
	\STATE Disable interrupts
	\STATE Release \texttt{conditionLock}
	\STATE \texttt{waitQueue.waitForAccess(KThread.currentThread())}
	\STATE	\texttt{KThread.sleep()}
	\STATE Acquire \texttt{conditionLock}
	\STATE Enable interrupts
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{ \texttt{void Condition2::wake()}}
      \begin{algorithmic}
	\STATE Disable interrupts
	\IF {\texttt{thread = waitQueue.nextThread() != null}}
	\STATE \texttt{thread.ready()}
	\ENDIF
	\STATE Enable interrupts
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{ \texttt{void Condition2::wakeAll()}}
      \begin{algorithmic}
	\STATE Disable interrupts
	\WHILE {\texttt{thread = waitQueue.nextThread() != null}}
	\STATE \texttt{thread.ready()}
	\STATE \texttt{thread = waitQueue.nextThread()}
	\ENDWHILE
	\STATE Enable interrupts
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \subsection{Testing Plan}
    We plan to run with function \texttt{selfTest()}, and the specific cases are as follows:
    \begin{asparaitem}
    \item Case 1: Two threads in which one is sleeper and the other is the waker.
    \item Case 2: Several sleepers with one waker.
    \item Case 3: Several sleepers together with several wakers.
    \end{asparaitem}
    \section{Task 3}
    \subsection{Overview}
    In this task, we need to finish the public functions \texttt{waitUntil(long x)} and \texttt{timerInterrupt()} in \texttt{Alarm}. The key point is that we have to invent some efficient method instead busy waiting in \texttt{waitUntil(long x)}. Since the \texttt{timerInterrupt()} handler can be called every dozens of clock ticks, we can drive threads to sleep in \texttt{waitUntil(long x)} and decide whether they should awake in \texttt{timerInterrupt()}.
    \subsection{Correctness Constraints}
    \begin{asparaitem}
    \item The methods of \texttt{waitUntil(long x)} and \texttt{timerInterrupt()} should be atomic so that the sleeping process can not be disturbed.
    \item A queue of waiting threads should be well-maintained by handler \texttt{timerInterrupt} and \texttt{waitUntil(long x)}. To be specific, every time \texttt{waitUntil(long x)} is called, it should insert the thread into a proper place in the queue and Handler \texttt{timerInterrupt} should properly dequeue every thread out when it's invoked.
    \end{asparaitem}
    \subsection{Declarations}
    \begin{asparaitem}
    \item Class: \texttt{AlarmThread} is a wrapper that associates \texttt{KThread} with wake up time.
    \item Instance: \texttt{queue} is a priority queue \texttt{PriorityQueue<AlarmThread>} that keeps a record of sleeping threads.
    \end{asparaitem}

    \subsection{Description}
    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{ \texttt{void Alarm::timerInterrupt()}}
      \begin{algorithmic}
	\STATE Disable interrupts
	\WHILE {\texttt{(queue.poll() != null) \&\& (queue.peek().wakeTime < Machine.timer().getTime())}}
	\STATE \texttt{queue.poll().thread.ready()}
	\ENDWHILE
	\STATE Enable interrupts
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \begin{algorithm}
      \caption{ \texttt{void Alarm::waitUntil(long x)}}
      \begin{algorithmic}
	\STATE Disable interrupts
	\STATE \texttt{long wakeTime = Machine.timer().getTime() + x}
	\STATE Insert \texttt{new AlarmThread(Kthread.currentThread() ,wakeTime)} into \texttt{queue}
	\STATE \texttt{Kthread.sleep()}
	\STATE Enable interrupts
      \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}
    \subsection{Testing Plan}
    \begin{asparaitem}
    \item Case 1: one thread with wait time $0$.
    \item Case 2: one thread with wait time within $500$.
    \item Case 3: one thread with wait time beyond $500$.
    \item Case 4: several threads with arbitrary wait time.
    \end{asparaitem}

    \section{Task 4}

    \subsection{Correctness Constraints}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[$\bullet$] An active speaker should wait until an listener becomes active and 
	recieves the word.
      \item[$\bullet$] At any time, there should be at most one active speaker.
      \item[$\bullet$] If there are some waiting speakers but no active speaker,
	some waiting speaker should become active.
      \item[$\bullet$] An active listener should wait until an active speaker becomes
	active and the listener recieves the speaker's word.
      \item[$\bullet$] At any time, there should be at most one active listener.
      \item[$\bullet$] If there are some waiting listeners but no active listener,
	some waiting listener should become active.
      \item[$\bullet$] Once the listener recieves the word, both the speaker and
	the listen should leave.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Declarations}
    Here we can see that the \texttt{Communicator} is a mutex resource, we need use
    a lock to protect this resource. And we can see that we need to maintain waiting
    speakers and listeners, we can use condition variables to manage them. And we 
    can find that active speaker and active listener need to cooperate with other
    threads, we also use condition variables to manage them. Finially, to check whether
    there is active speaker or listener, we use two boolean variables to indicate 
    respectively; and we use boolean variable to indicate whether the word is recieved.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[$\bullet$] \textit{data structure}: \texttt{Semaphore}, \texttt{Lock}.
      \item[$\bullet$] \textit{member variable}:
	The following variables are all the member variables of \texttt{Communicator},
	all of them are private. 
	\begin{enumerate}
	  \item \texttt{Lock lock};

      \item[] case 3: exchange the position between speaker and listener in case 1 and 2.
      \item[] case 4: 2 speaker and 2 listener and check if they form two pairs.(namely,
	speaker $i$ only speaks to listen $i$, $i=1,2$)
    \end{enumerate}
\section{Task 5}
\subsection{Overview}
Task 5 asks us to implement priority scheduling in Nachos by completing the \texttt{PriorityScheduler} class. Particularly, in choosing which  thread to dequeue, the scheduler always choose a thread of the highest effective priority (choose the one that has been waiting in the queue longest if multiple threads with the same highest priority are waiting).

The most difficulty lies in the function \texttt{Scheduler.getEffectivePriority}. To calculate one thread's effective priority (abbr. EP), we have to maintain a priority queue representing all threads it is getting priority from. Notice that when a thread's EP changes, threads' EP which that thread is waiting on may change as well. So we also need to maintain which thread is it waiting on for each thread. 

Specifically, we calculate a thread's prior it  by taking the max of the donor's and the recipient's priority. As for the transitive property of priority donation, we simply call \texttt{Scheduler.getEffectivePriority} recursively.

To speed up the calculation of EP, we create a variable to cache EP in class \texttt{ThreadState}. Thus, we only need to recalculate a thread's effective priority when it is possible for it to change.

\subsection{Correctness Constraints}

\begin{asparaitem}
\item All threads waiting in a queue are sorted by their effective priority\\
\item All threads store a linked list of queues they own and its own effective priority for cache\\
\item The effective priority of a thread is calculated by taking max between its initial priority and the largest effective priority stored in the linked list of queues.\\
\item When a thread is selected from the queue to acquire the resource (\texttt{nextThread}) that thread is removed from the queue and the new thread is told to aquire the queue (\texttt{acquire}) The previous owner of the queue is told it no longer owns this queue, and this queue is removed from its linked list. At the same time, this queue is inserted into the linked list of new owner. The new owner of the queue gets the highest priority in the queue added to its priority cache and its effective priority updated. \\
\item When a thread is added to the waiting queue (\texttt{waitForAccess}), it may have the highest priority of all threads in the queue. The owner of the queue then needs to update its effective priority to be greater than or equal to the new waiting thread.\\
\item When a change occurs to a thread's effective priority, it must reinsert itself into the correct position in the queue and as a result may end up affecting the effective priority of that queue's owner.
\end{asparaitem}

\subsection{Declarations}

We use \texttt{LinkedList<PriorityQueue> waitBy} and \texttt{PriorityQueue waitOn} to store threads waiting us and threads we are waiting separately. The class \texttt{PriorityQueue} is implemented by java.util.PriorityQueue.

\subsection{Descriptions}

The following algorithm describes the implementation of \texttt{getEffectivePriority} in high level.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{calculate effective priority}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \STATE Initialize EP and donatorEP as default priority
  \STATE EP $\leftarrow$ priority
\FORALL {wait queues whose resource has been acquired by me}
  \STATE donatorEP $\leftarrow$ largest EP in that wait queue
  \IF {donatorEP $>$ EP}
    \STATE EP $\leftarrow$ donatorEP
  \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\STATE recursively call calculate effective priority on the thread I am waiting on
\RETURN EP
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

To clarify how we manipulate data structure, we illustrate the implementation of function \linebreak \texttt{PriorityQueue.waitForAccess}, \texttt{PriorityQueue.acquire} and \texttt{PriorityQueue.nextThread} (actually, \linebreak \texttt{waitForAccess} and \texttt{acquire} are implemented in class \texttt{ThreadState}).

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{\texttt{ThreadState.wairForAccess(PriorityQueue waitQueue)}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \STATE waitQueue.add(this)  \COMMENT{add this thread to waitQueue}
  \STATE this.waitingOn $\leftarrow$ waitQueue  \COMMENT{update waitingOn queue}
  \STATE this.EP $\leftarrow$ calculateEffectivePriority()  \COMMENT{update EP}
\RETURN 
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{\texttt{ThreadState.acquire(PriorityQueue waitQueue)}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \STATE waitQueue.owner $\leftarrow$ this
  \STATE this.waitingBy.insert(waitQueue)
  \STATE this.EP $\leftarrow$ calculateEffectivePriority()  \COMMENT{update EP}
\RETURN 
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{\texttt{nextThread}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
  \STATE Initialize chosenThread as null
  \STATE chosenThread $\leftarrow$ pickNextThread()
  \IF {chosenThread != null}
    \STATE remove this queue from current owner's waitingBy list
    \STATE chosenThread.waitingOn $\leftarrow$ null
    \STATE insert this queue into chosenThread's waitingBy list
  \ENDIF
  \STATE this.owner $\leftarrow$ chosenThread
\RETURN chosenThread
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Testing Plan}

\section{Task 6}

\subsection{Implemented Strategy}
The strategy implemented is the same as the role-assigning strategy described in our design document. More specifically, we assigned three roles to all threads:
\begin{asparaitem}
  \item \textbf{Rower}: The child who is responsible to row the boat. We denote it by $R$.\\
  \item \textbf{Rider}: The child who is responsible to ride the boat of the rower. We denote it by $D$.\\
  \item Other people who are going to be carried by $R$ and $D$.\\
\end{asparaitem}

To carry an adult to Molokai, we used the following subroutine:\\
\begin{asparaitem}
  \item Two children go to Molokai, one rowing the boat and the other riding it.\\
  \item One child rows the boat back to Oahu.\\
  \item The adult rows to Molokai.\\
  \item The child left on Molokai rows the boat back to Oahu.\\
  \item Two children go to Molokai.\\
\end{asparaitem}

Also, to carry a child to Molokai, we used the following subroutine:
\begin{asparaitem}
  \item Two children go to Molokai, one rowing the boat and the other riding it.\\
  \item One child rows the boat back to Oahu.\\
  \item Two children go to Molokai.\\
\end{asparaitem}

The whole carring strategy is just the repeated execution of those two subroutines, and it can be described as follows:

\begin{asparaitem}
  \item We store the total number of adults and children in a global variable. Each time a person is created, the counter increases by one.\\
  \item All the children try to acquire the rower role, and only one of them get it, which is called as $R$.\\
  \item Those who failed to get the rower role try to acquire the rider role, and only one of them get it, which is  called as $D$. All the adults and the children who failed then waits to be carried to Molokai.\\
  \item When $D$ is picked from the children threads, the remaining threads are allowed to go across the sea. There is a global lock which all people except for $R$ and $D$ are waiting to acquire. If one person acquired the lock, he calls $R$ and $D$ to carry him to Molokai via one of the two subrountines, depending on whether it is a child or an adult. Then it decreases the population by 1, release the lock, and returns.\\
  \item At the end no one except $R$ and $D$ is running, and the population counter is 0. Then $R$ and $D$ perform the final rowing to Molokai and returns.
\end{asparaitem}

\subsection{Pseudocode}
The global variables are silghtly changed from our original design document.\\
\begin{asparaitem}
  \item \texttt{boolean isRowerSet}: The flag indicating if $R$ is set to a thread. All other threads should be able to read this.\\ 
  \item \texttt{boolean isRiderSet}: The flag indicating if $D$ is assigned to a thread. All other threads should be able to read this.\\
  \item \texttt{int population}: The population counter, initially set to 0. Whenever a person is created, this counter increases by 1; whenever a person gets across the sea, the counter decreases by 1.\\
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{BoatGrader bg}: I simply forgot to put this on the design document; it is always there.}\\
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{BoatChecker bc}: This BoatChecker is used to detect errors from the execution. For more details, go to see the testing part.}\\
\end{asparaitem}

Furthermore, we need the following locks and condition variables to achieve the goal:\\
\begin{asparaitem}
  \item \texttt{Lock AllMove}: During initialization of the threads, no person should be able to move, as they may incorrectly determine the situation that no one is present on Oahu as the final state if the forking of threads goes too slow. Therefore, we use the lock \texttt{AllMove} to block all threads but the main one to assure safe conditioning.\\
  \item \texttt{Lock End \& Condition CVEnd}: The lock and its corresponding condition variable which informs the main thread to quit. The $R$ thread will take charge of this lock until all people are across the sea. \textcolor{red}{For testing reasons, we used \texttt{Semaphore End} instead of original \texttt{Condition CVEnd}, and all other threads can thus wake up the main thread if they encounter an error. For more details, see the testing part.}\\
  \item \texttt{Lock RowerMove, Condition CVRowerMove \& Lock RiderMove, Condition CVRiderMove}: These two locks are designed to synchronize the protocol between $R$, $D$ and the person being carried. Note that there can only be one person who is waiting for the lock, or it will cause problem.\\
  \item \texttt{Lock BeingCarried}: The lock held by the person being carried across the sea. Note that there can only be one thread holding it.\\
  \item \texttt{Lock PollMutex}: The lock held by the child who is trying to be $R$ or $D$. \textcolor{red}{This is removed in our final implementation, and its function implemented by \texttt{Semaphore Register}.}\\
  \item \texttt{Semaphore Register:} This semaphore is due to ensure that all created threads has actually incremented the population counter. Whenever a thread is created, the main thread executing \texttt{begin(int,int, BoatGrader)} performs \texttt{P()} to the semaphore, and waits for the newly created thread to wake it up after it has incremented the counter. It can also be seen that this semaphore is able to protect the counter from mutual accessing. Initially it is set to 0.\\
  \item \texttt{Semaphore AllSet:} This semaphore is used by $D$ to tell the main thread that both $R$ and $D$ has been assigned. Only with this information, the main thread can release the \texttt{AllMove} lock. Initially it is set to 0. \textcolor{red}{This Semaphore is found unnecessary in the implementation, so it is removed.}\\
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{Lock LockTransmitted}: When a thread with no role is perparing to exit, it must give the \texttt{RowerMove} lock back to $R$. This lock is used to ensure that the \texttt{RowerMove} lock is correctly given to $R$ before the thread holding \texttt{BeingCarried} exits. An extra lock between them is found necessary.}\\
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{Semaphore errOccurs \& String errMessage}: These two variables deal with the error. Whenever an error occurs within one thread, the thread acquires \texttt{errOccurs} to protect \texttt{errMessage}, then it wakes up the main thread, which will read the message and throw it out as an exception.}\\
\end{asparaitem}

\textcolor{blue}{Moreover, we encapsulated all rowing and riding moves as static methods of \texttt{Boat} itself, and we send message to \texttt{bg} and \texttt{bc} at the same time. For example, the method \texttt{ChildRowToMolokai()} is equivalent to calling first \texttt{bg.ChildRowToMolokai()} and then \texttt{bc.ChildRowToMolokai()}. For more details, see the testing part.}\\

\subsection{Test Taken}
\subsubsection{Correctness Analysis}
To test the correctness of the role-assigning strategy, we used a class \texttt{BoatChecker} to take charge of all testing tasks.\\
When \texttt{begin()} is called, the BoatChecker \texttt{bc} is initialized with all people and the boat on Oahu. Each time someone row or ride the boat, it sends a message to \texttt{bc}, which will simulate the actual boat rowing and check for errors. Those errors can be divided into two kinds:
\begin{itemize}
  \item State transition error: the state transition is not permitted. We will discuss this later on.\\
  \item Population error: all the numbers of children and adults on both side of the sea should be always non-negative. \texttt{bc} will update th epopulation for each call, and if a negative population number is detected, \texttt{bc} will throw out an exception indicating that population error.\\
  \item Halting error: upon halting there should not be anyone on side Oahu. If there are still people waiting for carring when \texttt{begin()} is going to halt, there is a halting error.\\
\end{itemize}
The state of the boat rowing mechanism can be regarded as a DFA below:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[%
	>=stealth,
	node distance = 2cm,
	on grid,
	auto
	]
	\node[initial, initial text = ,state] (str) {STR};

    \node[state] (cdo) [below of= cro] {CDO};
    \node[state] (aro) [below of= cdo] {ARO};
    \node[state, accepting] (hlt) at (10, 0) {HLT};
    \node[state] (crm) [below of=hlt] {CRM};
    \node[state] (cdm) [below of = crm] {CDM};
    \node[state] (arm) [below of = cdm] {ARM};

    \path[->] 
    (str) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{AdultRowToMolokai()}} (arm)
    (str) edge [bend right]node {\texttt{ChildRowToMolokai()}} (cdm)

    (cdo) edge [bend right]node {\texttt{AdultRowToMolokai()}} (arm)
    (cdo) edge [bend right]node {\texttt{ChildRowToMolokai()}} (cdm)
    (crm) edge [bend right]node {\texttt{ChildRowToOahu()}} (cro)
    (crm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{AdultRowToOahu()}} (aro)
    (cdm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{ChildRowToOahu()}} (cro)
    (cdm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{AdultRowToOahu()}} (aro)
    (arm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{ChildRowToOahu()}} (cro)
    (arm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{AdultRowToOahu()}} (aro)
    (cro) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{ChildRideToOahu()}} (cdo)
    (crm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{ChildRideToMolokai()}} (cdm)
    (crm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{Halting()}} (hlt)
    (cdm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{Halting()}} (hlt)
    (arm) edge [bend right] node {\texttt{Halting()}} (hlt);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Each time a method is called, we check if the transition function is permissible. If so, \texttt{bc} updates the state inside it and waits for next call; otherwise \texttt{bc} will throw out an exception indicating that transition error.\\
If none of the three kinds of errors occur, the boat rowing scheme will halt normally without any error message. Then \texttt{bc} will output a success message.\\
\subsubsection{Efficiency Analysis}
To carry $a$ adults and $b$ children across the sea, it can be proved that the minimum number of steps is $5a+3b-4$. Each time a method is called, \texttt{bc} will increment a counter \texttt{step}, which is initialized to be 0. When \texttt{begin()} halts normally, \texttt{bc} will output 
$$\#\text{Steps taken/ \# Minimum steps}$$
as a measure of efficiency. Analysis relative to the clocktick has not been implemented yet.\\
